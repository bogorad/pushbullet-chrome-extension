# Pushbullet Chrome Extension - Development Status

## Current Mission: Centralize Popup Logging Through Background Script

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Problem Statement
Logs are currently split between the popup's console and the background script's debugLogger, making debugging difficult. Developers have to check two different locations to get a complete picture of what's happening in the extension. The popup's console logs are also not persisted, making it impossible to review them after the popup closes.

### Root Cause
The popup script uses `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` for logging, which writes to the popup's console. The background script uses `debugLogger`, which writes to the Debug Dashboard and persists logs. This architectural split creates a fragmented debugging experience.

### Solution Plan
Centralize all popup logging through the background script's debugLogger:
1. Create a `logToBackground` utility function in the popup
2. Implement a log message handler in the background script
3. Refactor `sendPush` to use centralized logging
4. Remove noisy DEBUG logs from background script
5. Bump version in manifest.json

## Previous Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: State Machine Hydration (Completed)
- **Problem:** State machine lost state across service worker restarts
- **Solution:** Implemented state persistence and hydration via chrome.storage
- **Files Modified:** `src/background/state-machine.ts`, `src/background/index.ts`
- **Version:** 1.1.15

### Fix 2: Device Nickname Update (Completed)
- **Problem:** Message action name mismatch between options page and background script
- **Solution:** Fixed message protocol to use correct action name and property
- **Files Modified:** `src/options/index.ts`, `src/background/index.ts`
- **Version:** 1.1.16

### Fix 3: Storage Race Condition (Completed)
- **Problem:** chrome.storage API unavailable immediately after service worker restart
- **Solution:** Implemented retry mechanism with `getApiKeyWithRetries()`
- **Files Modified:** `src/background/index.ts`
- **Version:** 1.1.17

### Fix 4: sendPush Handler Hardening (Completed) ✅ VALIDATED
- **Problem:** sendPush handler failed after service worker restart due to reading from in-memory state
- **Solution:** Added `ensureConfigLoaded()` call at beginning of handler to reload state from storage
- **Files Modified:** `src/background/index.ts`, `manifest.json`
- **Version:** 1.1.18
- **Validation:** User confirmed this fix addresses the exact bug observed in production logs where push sending failed with "Not logged in" error after service worker suspension. The log showed the state machine in `idle` state while WebSocket reported `Connected`, confirming the service worker had amnesia and the fix was necessary.

### Fix 5: Remove Unnecessary source_device_iden Parameter (Completed) ✅
- **Problem:** Push sending from popup was failing because unnecessary `source_device_iden` parameter was being sent to API
- **Solution:** Removed code block that adds `source_device_iden` to outgoing pushes from popup
- **Files Modified:** `src/popup/index.ts`, `manifest.json`
- **Version:** 1.1.20
- **Rationale:** The `source_device_iden` parameter is documented as optional and intended for reply scenarios ("useful when you need to send a push back to the sending device"). Including it in general push sending was unnecessary and potentially causing API rejections.

### Fix 6: Remove Faulty Authentication Check in Popup (Completed) ✅ CRITICAL
- **Problem:** Push sending from popup was failing silently because `if (!apiKey) return;` check used a module-level variable that was never re-populated when popup reopened
- **Solution:**
  1. Removed the faulty `if (!apiKey) return;` check from sendPush function
  2. Fixed file upload code to get API key from storage instead of using module-level variable
  3. Let background script handle authentication validation for all push types
- **Files Modified:** `src/popup/index.ts`, `manifest.json`
- **Version:** 1.1.21
- **Root Cause:** The popup's `apiKey` variable was only set when user saved their API key, not when popup reopened. This caused silent failures even though user was logged in.
- **Impact:** This was the actual root cause of push sending failures. The background script already has proper authentication validation with `ensureConfigLoaded()`, making the popup's check redundant and broken.

### Fix 7: Enhance sendPush Function with Comprehensive Logging (Completed) ✅
- **Problem:** sendPush function was failing silently with no visibility into execution flow or failure points
- **Solution:** Added comprehensive logging throughout the function:
  1. Entry logging to confirm function is called
  2. Log currentPushType value immediately to verify state
  3. Logging for each push type branch (note, link, file)
  4. Warning logs for all early exit points with reasons
  5. Enhanced existing logs with more context
  6. Improved error handling to log full error objects
- **Files Modified:** `src/popup/index.ts`, `manifest.json`
- **Version:** 1.1.22
- **Logging Added:**
  - Function entry: `[sendPush] Function initiated.`
  - State verification: `[sendPush] currentPushType is: '...'`
  - Branch logging: `[sendPush] Handling "note/link/file" type.`
  - Exit warnings: `[sendPush] Exiting: ...` (with specific reason)
  - Validation passed: `[sendPush] Validation passed. Preparing to send message...`
  - Response logging: `[sendPush] Received response from background script:`
  - Error logging: `[sendPush] Error sending message to background:` / `[sendPush] An unexpected error occurred...`
- **Impact:** Provides complete visibility into function execution flow, making it easy to identify where and why the function fails. All logs are prefixed with `[sendPush]` for easy filtering in the popup's developer console.

### Fix 8: Centralize Popup Logging Through Background Script (Completed) ✅
- **Problem:** Logs were split between popup's console and background script's debugLogger, making debugging difficult and preventing log persistence
- **Solution:** Centralized all popup logging through the background script's debugLogger:
  1. Created `logToBackground` utility function in popup with fallback error handling
  2. Implemented log message handler in background script with `[POPUP]` prefix
  3. Refactored `sendPush` to replace all console.log/warn/error with logToBackground
  4. Removed noisy DEBUG logs from background script's message listener and getDebugSummary handler
- **Files Modified:** `src/popup/index.ts`, `src/background/index.ts`, `manifest.json`
- **Version:** 1.1.23
- **Architecture Changes:**
  - Popup now sends log messages to background via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'log', payload: { level, message, data } })`
  - Background handler routes logs to debugLogger with `[POPUP]` prefix for source identification
  - Fallback to console logging if background is unavailable (with `[FALLBACK]` prefix)
  - INFO fallbacks are silent to avoid noise during service worker wake-up
- **Impact:** Single, centralized location (Debug Dashboard) for viewing all extension logs. Logs are now persisted and available even after popup closes. Cleaner debugging experience with all logs in one place.

## Notes
- All entry points that can wake the service worker must ensure core config is loaded
- Use `ensureCoreConfigIsLoaded()` helper function for consistency
- Always bump version after any change, however small
- To debug popup issues, check the Debug Dashboard instead of popup console - all logs now centralized there with `[POPUP]` prefix
