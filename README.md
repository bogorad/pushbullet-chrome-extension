## Architecture

### Manifest V3 Compliance
Built with Chrome's latest extension architecture:
- Service worker-based background script (no persistent background pages)
- Event-driven architecture with global event bus
- State machine for lifecycle management
- Keepalive mechanisms to maintain WebSocket connections

### Key Components
- **Background Service Worker** - Manages WebSocket connections, push handling, and notifications
- **State Machine** - Handles service worker lifecycle transitions (ACTIVE, DEGRADED, ERROR states)
- **Session Manager** - Maintains user session data (devices, chats, recent pushes)
- **WebSocket Client** - Real-time push delivery with automatic reconnection
- **Storage Layer** - IndexedDB for persistent logs and session cache, chrome.storage for settings
- **Debug System** - Comprehensive logging with persistent storage and dashboard UI

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates with API key
2. Session initialized (fetch user info, devices, chats, recent pushes)
3. WebSocket connection established for real-time pushes
4. Incoming pushes processed, decrypted (if E2E encrypted), and displayed
5. State machine monitors connection health, switches to polling if needed
6. Session data persisted to IndexedDB, survives service worker restarts

### Performance Optimizations
- **IndexedDB Hydration** - Session data cached in IndexedDB eliminates 2-3 second service worker wake-up delays
- **Race Condition Prevention** - Singleton promise pattern prevents duplicate initialization attempts
- **Background Refresh** - Fresh data fetched in background while cached data serves immediate UI requests
- **Cache Freshness** - 5-minute TTL with automatic background updates for data consistency

## Configuration

### Settings (Options Page)
Access via popup ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è icon:
- **Auto-Open Links** - Automatically open link pushes in background tabs
- **Notification Timeout** - How long notifications remain visible (seconds)
- **Device Nickname** - Name shown to other Pushbullet clients
- **Encryption Password** - Password for decrypting E2E encrypted pushes

### Debug Configuration (Debug Dashboard)
Access via popup ‚Üí üêõ icon ‚Üí Config tab:
- **Enable/Disable Logging** - Toggle debug log collection
- **Log Categories** - Filter by WEBSOCKET, NOTIFICATIONS, API, etc.
- **Log Level** - Set minimum level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- **Max Log Entries** - Limit log buffer size (default: 1000)

---

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Not Connecting
1. Open Debug Dashboard (üêõ icon)
2. Check "State Machine" status in Performance tab
3. Verify API key in settings
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Try "Refresh Session" in popup

### No Notifications Appearing
1. Check Chrome notification permissions for the extension
2. Verify system notifications are enabled in OS settings
3. Check Debug Dashboard ‚Üí Logs tab for errors
4. Ensure "Do Not Disturb" is disabled

### SMS Not Showing
1. Verify Android device is connected to Pushbullet
2. Check SMS permissions are granted on Android device
3. Enable SMS mirroring in Pushbullet Android app settings
4. Check Debug Dashboard for "sms_changed" push events

### Friends Not Appearing in Dropdown
1. Verify you have Pushbullet friends (add them on pushbullet.com)
2. Try "Refresh Session" in popup
3. Check Debug Dashboard ‚Üí Logs for "Chats loaded successfully"
4. Rebuild extension: `npm run build` and reload

### Service Worker Inactive
This is normal Manifest V3 behavior. The service worker:
- Wakes on events (alarms, messages, notifications)
- Maintains WebSocket with keepalive alarms (every 30 seconds)
- Persists state to IndexedDB before sleeping

### Export Debug Logs
If issues persist:
1. Open Debug Dashboard (üêõ icon)
2. Click "Export JSON" or "Export Text"
3. Share logs when reporting issues on GitHub

---

## Privacy & Security

### Data Storage
- **API Key** - Stored locally in `chrome.storage.local` (not synced, plain text)
- **Session Data** - Cached in IndexedDB (devices, chats, recent pushes)
- **Debug Logs** - Stored locally in IndexedDB (last 5,000 entries)
- **Settings** - Stored in `chrome.storage.local`

### Security Measures
- End-to-end encryption support for sensitive pushes (password-based)
- Message sender validation prevents external script injection
- XSS protection via Content Security Policy and input sanitization
- Image URLs validated against trusted domains (Pushbullet, Google)
- No data sent to third parties (only communicates with Pushbullet API)

### Permissions Required
- `storage` - Save settings and session data
- `notifications` - Show push notifications
- `alarms` - Keep service worker alive, periodic health checks
- `contextMenus` - Right-click push actions
- Host permissions for `api.pushbullet.com` and `stream.pushbullet.com`

## Development

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Debug Logging
Enable comprehensive logging:
1. Open Debug Dashboard (üêõ icon in popup)
2. Toggle "Enable Debug Logging" switch
3. Select log categories to monitor
4. Set log level (DEBUG for verbose output)

### Hot Reload Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
This watches for file changes and rebuilds automatically. Reload the extension in Chrome after builds complete.
