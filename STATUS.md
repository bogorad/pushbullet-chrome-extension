# Pushbullet Chrome Extension Analysis

## Task

Analyze the codebase to understand why mobile notifications are not being displayed in the Chrome extension, while other push types (notes, links, files) are working correctly. Provide guidance to a junior developer on how to investigate and fix the issue.

## Plan

1.  [ ] Ingest the complete codebase using `repomix` for a comprehensive overview.
2.  [ ] Analyze the code to understand how different push types are handled:
    *   [ ] Notes
    *   [ ] Links
    *   [ ] Files
    *   [ ] Notifications (Mirroring)
3.  [ ] Formulate a hypothesis for why notification mirroring is failing.
4.  [ ] Provide guidance to a junior developer on where to look for the problem and how to approach a fix, without modifying the code directly.
