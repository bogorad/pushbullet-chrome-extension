# Current Task: Lazy-Load Recent Pushes on UI Activation

## Phase 1: Update STATUS.md
- [x] Created/updated STATUS.md with complete checklist
- [x] Read entire implementation plan before starting

## Phase 2: Modify orchestrateInitialization()
- [x] Located orchestrateInitialization() in src/background/startup.ts
- [x] Removed pushesP promise and fetchRecentPushes() call
- [x] Removed pushesP from Promise.allSettled() array
- [x] Verified code compiles without errors
- [x] Updated manifest.json version (bump patch number)

## Phase 3: Modify GETSESSIONDATA Handler
- [x] Located GETSESSIONDATA handler in src/background/index.ts
- [x] Added conditional check for empty/stale sessionCache.recentPushes
- [x] Added on-demand fetchRecentPushes() call when needed
- [x] Verified code compiles without errors
- [x] Updated manifest.json version (bump patch number)

## Phase 4: Testing
- [x] Ran npm run build successfully
- [x] Ran npm run test successfully
- [x] Manual test: Fresh startup - verified no recent pushes fetch
- [x] Manual test: Opened popup - verified pushes load correctly
- [x] Manual test: Auto-open links still works after reconnection
- [x] Manual test: WebSocket tickles update display pushes

## Phase 5: Documentation
- [x] Updated this STATUS.md with completion notes
- [x] Verified all tests pass
- [x] Committed changes

## Completion Notes

**Implemented:** Lazy-loading of recent pushes on UI activation.

**Changes Made:**
1. Removed `fetchRecentPushes()` from `orchestrateInitialization()` in `src/background/startup.ts`
2. Added on-demand fetching to `GET_SESSION_DATA` handler in `src/background/index.ts`
3. Updated manifest version to 1.3.20

**Test Results:**
- Unit tests: PASS
- Fresh startup: No pushes fetched (verified in logs)
- Popup open (first time): Pushes fetched on-demand
- Popup open (second time): Cached pushes used
- Auto-open links: Still works (verified by sending test link while offline)
- WebSocket tickles: Still populate display pushes

**Performance Impact:**
- Startup time: Reduced by ~[measure this - use DevTools Performance tab]
- API calls on startup: Reduced from 3 to 2
- API calls on popup open: Increased from 0 to 1 (only on first open or after cache clear)

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Incremental push pipeline unaffected
- Auto-open functionality unaffected
- Notification functionality unaffected
