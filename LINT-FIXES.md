# Product Requirements Document: Linting Fixes

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the linting issues found in the codebase. The goal is to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability by addressing all reported linting warnings.

## 2. Background

A recent linting run of the codebase revealed 106 warnings. These warnings, while not breaking the application, indicate areas where the code can be improved to adhere to best practices and coding standards. Addressing these issues will lead to a cleaner and more professional codebase.

## 3. Requirements

The following are the high-level requirements for this task:

*   **Fix all linting warnings:** All 106 warnings reported by the linter should be addressed.
*   **Maintain existing functionality:** The fixes should not introduce any regressions or changes in the application's behavior.
*   **Follow project conventions:** All changes should be made in accordance with the existing coding style and conventions of the project.

## 4. Issue Categories

The linting warnings can be broadly categorized into two types:

### 4.1. Unused Variables (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`)

There are numerous instances of variables that are defined but never used. These unused variables add clutter to the code and can make it harder to understand.

**Example:**

```typescript
// C:\Users\chuck\git\pushbullet-chrome-extension\src\app\notifications\index.ts
129:12  warning  '_' is defined but never used  @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
```

**Proposed Fix:**

Remove the unused variables. In cases where a variable is intentionally unused (e.g., in a function signature), prefix it with an underscore (`_`) to signal this intent to the linter. If the variable is already an underscore, it should be removed.

### 4.2. Incorrect Indentation (`indent`)

There are several files with incorrect indentation. Consistent indentation is crucial for code readability.

**Example:**

```typescript
// C:\Users\chuck\git\pushbullet-chrome-extension\src\app\ws\client.ts
184:1   warning  Expected indentation of 10 spaces but found 12  indent
```

**Proposed Fix:**

Fix the indentation in the affected files to match the project's established style. This can be done automatically by running `npm run lint:fix` or by manually adjusting the indentation in a code editor.

## 5. Remediation Plan

The following steps will be taken to address the linting issues:

1.  **Automatic Fixes:** Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix as many issues as possible. This is expected to resolve the majority of the indentation and some of the unused variable warnings.
2.  **Manual Fixes:** Manually review the remaining warnings and fix them. This will involve removing unused variables and fixing any other issues that could not be automatically resolved.
3.  **Verification:** Run `npm run lint` again to ensure that all warnings have been resolved.
4.  **Testing:** Run the test suite (`npm run test`) to ensure that the changes have not introduced any regressions.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

*   `npm run lint` runs without reporting any warnings.
*   `npm run test` passes successfully.
*   The application's functionality remains unchanged.
