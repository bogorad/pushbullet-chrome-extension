## Phase 6: Architectural Improvements (NEW - In Progress)

### High Priority #1: Remove Redundant WebSocket from Popup
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓
**Impact**: Dual state, resource waste, connection lost when popup closes
**Solution**: Remove all WebSocket logic from popup, rely on background script exclusively

- [v] Identify all WebSocket-related code in src/popup/index.ts
- [v] Identify all popup functions that currently use WebSocket data
- [v] Remove `let websocket` variable declaration (line 86)
- [v] Remove `connectWebSocket()` function (lines 414-464)
- [v] Remove `disconnectWebSocket()` function (lines 469-474)
- [v] Remove WebSocket event handlers (onopen, onmessage, onerror, onclose)
- [v] Update popup to request data via chrome.runtime.sendMessage only
- [v] Verify popup still receives push updates from background (onMessage listener exists)
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.61 → 1.0.62

### High Priority #2: Missing return true (VERIFIED AS FALSE POSITIVE)
**Status**: ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Code already has return true statements
**Finding**: Lines 7614, 7647, 15574, 15607 already have `return true;`
**Action**: NO CHANGES NEEDED - Expert claim was incorrect

- [v] Verify refreshSession handler (HAS return true on line 7614)
- [v] Verify updateDeviceNickname handler (HAS return true on line 7647)
- [v] Verify getSessionData async branches (HAS return true on lines 7467, 7504, 7540)
- [v] Document finding: Expert claim #2 is FALSE POSITIVE

### Medium Priority: XSS Sanitization Enhancement
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓ (Already secure - documentation added)
**Impact**: Potential DOM-based XSS despite CSP protection
**Solution**: Verified textContent usage, added defense-in-depth documentation

- [v] Locate all uses of sanitizeText in codebase (background/utils.ts only)
- [v] Identify all innerHTML assignments in UI code (mostly static content)
- [v] Verify popup uses textContent for user data (CONFIRMED - lines 506, 514, 524, 532)
- [v] Keep sanitizeText for notification content (appropriate use case)
- [v] Add comment documenting defense-in-depth strategy
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.62 → 1.0.63

**Finding**: Popup already uses textContent correctly for all user-generated content.
No code changes needed - only added documentation to sanitizeText function.

### Low Priority: Simplify getSessionData Timeout Logic
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓
**Impact**: Potential incomplete data if init takes >10 seconds
**Solution**: Use initPromise directly instead of polling

- [v] Locate getSessionData timeout logic in src/background/index.ts (lines 363-386)
- [v] Export getInitPromise() getter from src/app/session/index.ts
- [v] Replace setInterval polling with direct initPromise await
- [v] Simplify wake-up detection logic (removed maxWait timeout)
- [v] Rely on promise resolution instead of polling initializationState
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.63 → 1.0.64

**Improvement**: Replaced 10-second polling loop with direct promise await.
More reliable and eliminates arbitrary timeout.

### Testing for New Changes
- [ ] Write test for popup-background communication (no WebSocket)
- [ ] Write test for XSS sanitization (textContent usage)
- [ ] Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Run language server diagnostics on modified files
- [ ] Run ESLint on modified files
- [ ] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.64 → 1.0.65

---

## Files to Modify (Phase 6)
- [ ] src/popup/index.ts (remove WebSocket logic)
- [ ] src/background/index.ts (simplify getSessionData timeout)
- [ ] src/background/utils.ts (document sanitization strategy)
- [ ] manifest.json (version bumps: 1.0.61 → 1.0.65)
- [ ] tests/popup/communication.test.ts (NEW - test popup-background messaging)

## Version History (Phase 6-7)
- 1.0.61: Starting version (after unit test implementation)
- 1.0.62: Redundant WebSocket removed from popup
- 1.0.63: XSS sanitization enhanced (textContent usage)
- 1.0.64: getSessionData timeout logic simplified
- 1.0.65: Promise rejection handlers added to popup sendMessage calls
- 1.0.66: Complete API centralization - popup is now a "dumb client"
- 1.0.67: Removed setTimeout hack - proper async response handling
- 1.0.68: Storage Repository Pattern - core modules refactored
- 1.0.69: Event Bus Pattern - components decoupled with event-driven architecture
- 1.0.70: State Machine Pattern - centralized lifecycle management

---

## Phase 6.2: Complete API Centralization (COMPLETE)

### Critical Priority: Remove ALL Direct API Calls from Popup
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓
**Impact**: Popup was making 3 API calls EVERY TIME it opened (inefficient, dual state)
**Solution**: Made popup a "dumb client" that only requests data from background

**Self-Critique**: In Phase 6, I only removed the WebSocket but left all the direct
API calls (fetchUserInfo, fetchDevices, fetchRecentPushes). This was an INCOMPLETE
implementation of the expert's recommendation. The expert clearly stated ALL API
communication should be centralized in the background script. This phase completes
the architectural refactoring.

#### Tasks:
- [v] Remove fetchUserInfo() from popup (replaced with comment)
- [v] Remove fetchDevices() from popup (replaced with comment)
- [v] Remove fetchRecentPushes() from popup (replaced with comment)
- [v] Remove initializeAuthenticated() from popup (replaced with comment)
- [v] Modify checkStorageForApiKey() to use getSessionData message
- [v] Add sendPush handler to background script (lines 616-663)
- [v] Modify popup sendPush() to delegate to background
- [v] Modify saveApiKey() to delegate validation to background
- [v] Verify popup makes ZERO direct API calls (except file upload*)
- [v] Test popup functionality with background-only API calls
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.65 → 1.0.66
- [v] All tests pass (14/14)

**Exception**: File upload still requires direct API access because FormData cannot
be serialized through chrome.runtime.sendMessage. The final push creation is still
delegated to background.

---

## Phase 6.3: Remove setTimeout Hack in saveApiKey (COMPLETE)

### Medium Priority: Replace setTimeout with Proper Async Response
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓
**Impact**: 500ms setTimeout was unreliable (too short on slow connections, too long on fast)
**Solution**: Made apiKeyChanged handler return async response after initialization complete

**Expert Observation**: "On a slow connection, 500ms might not be enough, and on a fast
connection, it introduces an unnecessary delay. It can also create a brief 'flash' where
the popup might show a partial or loading state."

#### Tasks:
- [v] Modify background apiKeyChanged handler to return async response
- [v] Wait for refreshSessionCache to complete before responding
- [v] Move connectWebSocket() call inside promise (after session ready)
- [v] Return session data in response (eliminates second getSessionData call)
- [v] Remove setTimeout from popup saveApiKey function
- [v] Use sendResponse callback to get session data directly
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.66 → 1.0.67
- [v] All tests pass (14/14)

**Improvement**: Popup now receives session data immediately after background completes
initialization, with no arbitrary delays or race conditions.

---

## Phase 7: Architectural Refactoring (NEW - Educational Plan)

### Overview
Expert provided a comprehensive educational plan for architectural improvements:
1. **Phase 7.1**: Storage Repository Pattern (Abstract chrome.storage)
2. **Phase 7.2**: Event Bus Pattern (Decouple components)
3. **Phase 7.3**: Documentation (ADRs for architectural decisions)

**Guiding Principles**:
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

---

## Phase 7.1: Storage Repository Pattern (COMPLETE - Core Refactoring)

### Goal: Abstract chrome.storage into Repository Pattern
**Status**: COMPLETE (Core modules refactored) ✓
**Impact**: Improves testability, maintainability, and clarity
**Solution**: Create StorageRepository interface and ChromeStorageRepository implementation

**Why?**
- **Testability**: Hard to test code that directly uses chrome API - abstraction allows mocking
- **Maintainability**: Changes to storage logic only need to happen in one place
- **Clarity**: Rest of code can use simple methods like `storage.getApiKey()`

#### Step 1.1: Define Storage Interface
- [v] Create src/infrastructure/storage/ folder
- [v] Create storage.repository.ts file
- [v] Define StorageRepository interface with all storage operations

#### Step 1.2: Implement Chrome Storage Repository
- [v] Create ChromeStorageRepository class implementing interface
- [v] Promisify all chrome.storage calls
- [v] Implement all methods (getApiKey, setApiKey, etc.)
- [v] Export singleton instance

#### Step 1.3: Integrate into Core Modules
- [v] Import ChromeStorageRepository in background/index.ts
- [v] Create single instance of repository
- [v] Replace all chrome.storage.* calls in background/index.ts (8 instances)
- [v] Replace all chrome.storage.* calls in app/session/index.ts (5 instances)
- [v] Replace all chrome.storage.* calls in popup/index.ts (6 instances)
- [v] Replace all chrome.storage.* calls in options/index.ts (11 instances, 2 debug config remain)

#### Step 1.4: Testing & Verification
- [v] Update test mocks to use storage repository
- [v] All tests passing (14/14)
- [v] No TypeScript errors
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.67 → 1.0.68

**Current Status**: CORE REFACTORING COMPLETE ✓
- ✅ Repository pattern implemented and working
- ✅ Background script refactored (8 calls → 0)
- ✅ Session module refactored (5 calls → 0)
- ✅ Popup refactored (6 calls → 0)
- ✅ Options page refactored (13 calls → 2 debug config calls remain)
- ✅ All tests passing with updated mocks
- ⚠️ Remaining files (not critical for core functionality):
  * src/app/api/client.ts (11 calls - device registration logic)
  * src/app/reconnect/index.ts (2 calls)
  * src/lib/logging/index.ts (2 calls - debug config)
  * src/options/index.ts (2 calls - debug config)

**Success Criteria**: Core modules use repository pattern
**Actual**: ✅ All core modules (background, session, popup, options) refactored successfully

---

## Phase 7.2: Event Bus Pattern (COMPLETE)

### Goal: Decouple Components with Event-Driven Architecture
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓
**Impact**: Removes tight coupling between WebSocketClient and background script
**Solution**: Implement event bus for component communication

**Expert Observation**: "The WebSocketClient shouldn't need to know that an updateConnectionIcon
function exists. It should just announce 'I'm connected!' Anyone who cares can listen for that
announcement."

#### Step 2.1: Create Event Bus
- [v] Create src/lib/events/event-bus.ts
- [v] Implement simple EventBus class with on/off/emit/once methods
- [v] Export global singleton instance
- [v] Comprehensive documentation

#### Step 2.2: Refactor WebSocketClient
- [v] Remove setHandlers method
- [v] Remove handlers property and WebSocketHandlers interface
- [v] Emit events instead of calling handlers
- [v] Events implemented:
  * websocket:connected
  * websocket:disconnected
  * websocket:state (for popup)
  * websocket:push
  * websocket:tickle:push
  * websocket:tickle:device
  * websocket:polling:check
  * websocket:polling:stop

#### Step 2.3: Update Background Script
- [v] Remove websocketClient.setHandlers() call
- [v] Add event listeners using globalEventBus.on()
- [v] Listen for all 8 WebSocket events
- [v] Same functionality, decoupled architecture

#### Step 2.4: Testing & Verification
- [v] All 14 tests passing
- [v] No TypeScript errors
- [v] WebSocketClient has no setHandlers method
- [v] Background uses event bus exclusively
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.68 → 1.0.69

**Success Criteria**: ✅ WebSocketClient emits events, background listens via event bus
**Benefits**: Improved testability, flexibility, and separation of concerns

---

## Phase 7.3: Documentation & ADRs (COMPLETE)

### Goal: Document Architectural Decisions
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓
**Impact**: Knowledge sharing and long-term project health
**Solution**: Create Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

**Expert Observation**: "This is a process improvement that is easy to overlook but provides
immense value for team collaboration and long-term project health."

#### Step 3.1: Create ADR Infrastructure
- [v] Create docs/adr/ folder
- [v] Create ADR template (template.md)
- [v] Create README.md with ADR index

#### Step 3.2: Document Key Decisions
- [v] ADR 0001: Initialization Race Condition (Promise Singleton)
- [v] ADR 0002: Storage Repository Pattern
- [v] ADR 0003: Event Bus Pattern
- [v] ADR 0004: API Centralization (Dumb Client Pattern)

#### Step 3.3: Documentation Complete
- [v] All ADRs follow standard format (Status, Context, Decision, Consequences)
- [v] ADRs include code examples and metrics
- [v] README.md explains ADR process and links to all ADRs

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ADRs created for all major architectural decisions
**Benefits**: Future developers can understand why the code is structured this way

---

## Phase 7.4: State Machine Pattern (COMPLETE)

### Goal: Centralize Service Worker Lifecycle Logic
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓
**Impact**: Eliminates scattered state flags, makes behavior predictable
**Solution**: Implement State Machine to manage service worker lifecycle

**Expert Observation**: "Replace the scattered state management (various flags like
`initializationState.inProgress`, `isPollingMode`, etc.) with a single, explicit state
machine. This will make the service worker's behavior predictable and bulletproof."

#### Phase 1: Design and Documentation
- [v] Define ServiceWorkerState enum (IDLE, INITIALIZING, READY, DEGRADED, ERROR)
- [v] Define ServiceWorkerEvent type (STARTUP, API_KEY_SET, etc.)
- [v] Create state transition table (11 transitions documented)
- [v] Create ADR 0005: Service Worker State Machine

#### Phase 2: Implementation
- [v] Create ServiceWorkerStateMachine class (270 lines)
- [v] Implement transition() method with logging
- [v] Implement getNextState() method (transition table logic)
- [v] Implement onStateEnter() method (side effects)
- [v] Implement onStateExit() method (cleanup)
- [v] Add helper methods (getCurrentState, isInState, getStateDescription)

#### Phase 3: Integration
- [v] Instantiate state machine in background script with callbacks
- [v] Connect onStartup/onInstalled to state machine (STARTUP event)
- [v] Connect event bus to state machine (WS_CONNECTED, WS_DISCONNECTED)
- [v] Refactor apiKeyChanged to use state machine (API_KEY_SET event)
- [v] Refactor logout to use state machine (LOGOUT event)

#### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
- [v] All 14 tests passing
- [v] No TypeScript errors
- [v] State transitions logged and traceable
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.69 → 1.0.70

**Success Criteria**: ✅ All lifecycle logic managed by state machine
**Benefits**: Predictable behavior, explicit transitions, no invalid states, easy to debug

---

## Phase 6.1: Promise Rejection Handling (COMPLETE)

### Medium Priority: Unhandled Promise Rejections in Popup
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓
**Impact**: Potential "Uncaught (in promise)" errors in console
**Solution**: Add .catch() handlers to all chrome.runtime.sendMessage calls

- [v] Add .catch() to apiKeyChanged message (line 275-281)
- [v] Add .catch() to logout message (line 302-305)
- [v] Verify no other unhandled promises in popup
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.64 → 1.0.65
- [v] All tests pass (14/14)

**Finding**: Background script already has .catch() handlers (line 112), but popup did not.
**Fix**: Added console.warn() handlers to both sendMessage calls for better error visibility.
