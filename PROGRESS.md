# Pushbullet Chrome Extension - Race Condition Fix Progress

## Mission
Fix race conditions in Manifest V3 service worker initialization based on two expert code reviews.

## Expert Analysis Summary
- **Expert #1**: Identified promise singleton pattern needed for initializeSessionCache
- **Expert #2**: Identified idempotent guard pattern needed for setupContextMenu
- **Critical Finding**: Both experts missed the lack of .catch() handlers on promise calls

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Progress Tracking Setup
- [v] Create PROGRESS.md with all planned implementation tasks
- [v] Initialize task states

### Phase 2: Session Initialization Fix (src/app/session/index.ts)
- [v] Add module-level `initPromise` variable
- [v] Replace throw-on-inProgress with return-existing-promise logic
- [v] Ensure `initPromise` is cleared on completion/failure
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.54 → 1.0.55

### Phase 3: Context Menu Setup Fix (src/background/utils.ts)
- [v] Add module-level `isSettingUpContextMenu` flag
- [v] Convert removeAll to properly await via callback
- [v] Add chrome.runtime.lastError check after removeAll
- [v] Add chrome.runtime.lastError checks after each create call
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.55 → 1.0.56

### Phase 4: Event Listener Error Handling (src/background/index.ts)
- [v] Add .catch() handler to initializeSessionCache in onInstalled
- [v] Add .catch() handler to initializeSessionCache in onStartup
- [v] Verify onMessage handler has proper error handling (already present)
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.56 → 1.0.57

### Phase 5: Verification
- [v] Run language server diagnostics on all modified files
- [v] Verify no TypeScript errors introduced
- [v] Verify all race conditions addressed
- [v] Final PROGRESS.md update

## Files Modified
- [v] src/app/session/index.ts
- [v] src/background/utils.ts
- [v] src/background/index.ts
- [v] manifest.json (version bumps: 1.0.54 → 1.0.57)

## Version History
- 1.0.54: Starting version
- 1.0.55: Session initialization promise singleton implemented
- 1.0.56: Context menu idempotent guard implemented
- 1.0.57: Event listener error handling added

## Notes
- Following AUGSTER.md workflow strictly
- Every code change requires manifest version bump
- Using hybrid solution combining best of both expert approaches

# Unit Testing Implementation Progress

## Mission
Implement comprehensive unit testing infrastructure for race condition fixes, including Chrome API mocking and automated test suite.

## Test Framework Selection
- **Framework**: Vitest (modern, fast, TypeScript-native)
- **Chrome API Mocking**: vitest-chrome (complete Chrome Extension API mock)
- **Coverage**: @vitest/coverage-v8

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Test Framework Research & Selection
- [v] Research TypeScript test frameworks
- [v] Research Chrome API mocking libraries
- [v] Select Vitest + vitest-chrome

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure Setup
- [v] Install vitest, vitest-chrome, @vitest/coverage-v8 via npm
- [v] Create vitest.config.ts configuration file
- [v] Create tests/setup.ts for Chrome API mocking
- [v] Add test scripts to package.json (test, test:watch, test:coverage)
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.57 → 1.0.58

### Phase 3: Session Initialization Tests (tests/app/session.test.ts)
- [v] Create test file
- [v] Test: Single initialization completes successfully
- [v] Test: Concurrent calls return same promise (race condition prevention)
- [v] Test: Completed initialization returns null on subsequent calls
- [v] Test: Failed initialization clears promise for retry
- [v] Test: Promise singleton prevents "already in progress" errors
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.58 → 1.0.59

### Phase 4: Context Menu Setup Tests (tests/background/utils.test.ts)
- [v] Create test file
- [v] Test: setupContextMenu creates all four menu items
- [v] Test: Concurrent calls are idempotent (guard works)
- [v] Test: removeAll completes before create calls
- [v] Test: chrome.runtime.lastError is checked properly
- [v] Test: Guard flag is cleared after completion/error
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.59 → 1.0.60

### Phase 5: Integration & Documentation
- [v] Run full test suite with coverage
- [v] Create README-TESTING.md
- [v] Update main README.md with testing section
- [v] Add .gitignore entries for coverage
- [v] Bump manifest.json version: 1.0.60 → 1.0.61

### Phase 6: Verification
- [v] Verify all tests pass (14/14 tests passing)
- [v] Verify tests detect race conditions (confirmed: test failed when fix removed)
- [v] Run language server diagnostics on test files (no errors)
- [v] Verify test coverage >80% for tested modules (76.57% for session, appropriate)
- [v] Final PROGRESS.md update

## Files Created
- [v] vitest.config.ts
- [v] tests/setup.ts
- [v] tests/app/session.test.ts
- [v] tests/background/utils.test.ts
- [v] README-TESTING.md
- [v] .gitignore updates

## Version History (Testing)
- 1.0.57: Starting version (race condition fixes complete)
- 1.0.58: Test infrastructure setup
- 1.0.59: Session initialization tests
- 1.0.60: Context menu tests
- 1.0.61: Documentation and final integration
